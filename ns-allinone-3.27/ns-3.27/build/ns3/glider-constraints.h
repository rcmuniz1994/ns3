/**
 *
 *
 * A TYPHOON class AUV is an submarine-like device, propelled by some electric motors.
 *
 * The model is based on the characteristics of the TYPHOON AUV (DIEF University of Florence, MDM Lab) . The robot has 5 DOF.
 *
 * - maximum operating depth, 100 m
 * - maximum speed (on a plane) 1.5 m/s
 * - maximum speed (ascending or descending) 0.25 m/s
 * - maximum rotational speed (along z-axis) 18Â°/s
 * - the robot cannot move with a pitch angle different from zero.
 *
 * The function CheckPath gives a list of feasible intermediate waypoints between a start ("start") and an end point ("stop").
 *
 * Considering the cinematic constraints of the robot, given these two points, the situation goes as follow:
 *
 * - firstly (if necessary), the robot ascends or descends at the depth of the "stop" point;
 * - then (if necessary), it rotates along the z-axis in order to align itself towards the "stop" point;
 * - then (if necessary), it goes straight towards the "stop" point
